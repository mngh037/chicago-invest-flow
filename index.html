        Segregation in <a href="https://www.wbez.org/race-class-communities/2023/06/19/chicago-remains-the-most-segregated-big-city-in-america" target="_blank">America's most segregated city</a>, revealed through its funding flow
      </p>

      <p class="text-body">
        Home to a population of 2.6 million (2023), Chicago makes itself known as the largest city in the Midwest, boasting of opportunities, diversity, and big-city glamour. However, while its reputation for high crime rate is equally matched, Chicago's deeply rooted history of segregation is much lesser known but to dwellers of the city, yet plays an important role in shaping its economic and development landscape. Using data from the Urban Institute, the article seeks to address this issue by means of presenting investment flow in different communities or neighborhoods in Chicago, thus highlighting how this plays out as the most fundamental cause to the city's persisting racial and ethnic disparities.

				Understanding the Data
			</h2>
			<p class="text-body">
        Investment data used in this analysis was collected from 2010-2020 and reflects much of the city's efforts in community development through various aspects, such as enabling affordable housing, invigorating economic growth, and promoting equitable development. Notably, the data was the product of extensive research and was scaled by direct beneficiaries of the investment at the tract level, thus enabling sound comparisons across cities and neighborhoods. Details of each investment category are discussed in the Urban Institute's data catalog, though it would be helpful to familiarize ourselves with some of the types before moving forward:

      <div class="column is-full text-body">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Non-residential investment</strong> refers to loans for non-residential capital investment such as commercial, industrial, and agricultural properties. <i>This is scaled by the number of employees in the area.</i></li>
        <li><strong>Small-business loans</strong> refers to loans to business whose revenues run under $1 million. <i>This is scaled by the number of small business employees.</i></li>
        <li><strong>Community development funds</strong> refers to “mission lending” from community development financial institutions and socially motivated lenders. <i>This is scaled by the number of households in the area.</i></li>
        <li><strong>Federal community development funds</strong> refers to federal community development funding and the city’s public financing. <i>This is scaled by the number of households in the area.</i></li>
        <li><strong>Purchase loans per renter-occupied household</strong> refers to purchase loans for multifamily properties (5+ units). This is scaled by the number of renter-occupied households living in properties with five or more units.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase loans per owner-occupied household</strong> refers to purchase loans for single-family properties (1-4 units). <i>This is scaled by the number of owner-occupied households.</i></li>
        <li><strong>Aggregate investment</strong> refers to the overall investment. <i>This is scaled by the number of households.</i></li>

				Where Chicago stands among US's biggest cities
			</h2>

      <p class="text-body">
        In terms of overall investment per household, Chicago on average ranked 40th out of US's top 100 big cities by population size and 2nd in the Midwest (losing to Wisconsin's capital Madison). Based from this sample, there seems to be an inverse relationship between a city's poverty percentage and the investment in development it receives. Interestingly, cities in the West received on average more investment per household than their counterparts in other regions of the US.

        All investment categories saw an upward trajectory, increasing at a remarkable rate especially in 2010-2013 period that marked the US's recovery from the Great Recession. While more money went in non-residential development cause on aggregate, residents of single-family units benefitted significantly when scaled by direct beneficiary.

				Racial and Poverty Disparity in Chicago's capital flow

			<p class="text-body">
        The graph shows average scaled investment for communities with a race majority presence. A notable pattern in overall investment is how investment decreased the more a community comprises largely of Blacks or Latinos. Community development funds is an exception to this observation, though it is worth noting that this is the investment category with the lowest amount received by beneficiary.

        The data also explores investment across poverty categories. With the exception of a few categories where no significant differences could be seen, it appears that communities with lower rate of poverty were receiving more investment money on average during the 10 years period studied.

        The map aggregates data on investment at the tract level. Beside showing the racial and poverty disparities in capital flow in Chicago in a different format from that presented above, the map also illustrates this segregation on a geographic level—how the loop and north/west side of Chicago was much more heavily invested than the lower south where we see a much higher rate of poverty and concentration of people of color neighborhoods.
