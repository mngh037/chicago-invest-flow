# Project Name
Chicago Investment Flow Project: Where does the money go?

Minh Nghiem

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

I ended up picking proposal #2 for the project. The current goal remains the same as proposed: to explore different types of investment that are going in community development and the course of those investment flows in different communities in Chicago to reveal disparity patterns, geographically, racially, and poverty-wise. The approach/structure of presentation changes a bit, however: instead of a dashboard with a scrolly-telling style, I'm leaning towards an article-like presentation for less movement and more user-driven interactivity with the visualizations.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?
Graphs are made with real data and are 90% ready now. I'll have some modification based on some ideas and the feedback I got from group critique session, though I don't anticipate them to have major changes.

No data challenge but writing HTML/CSS is proving rather difficult for me. I'm working on it though.

## Walk us through an interaction, either in words or you can record a quick 2-3 minute video.
The main piece of interaction would be the map of Chicago by tract. Hovering over each tract would give you info of the tract, including tract ID, neighborhood, investment percentile. Clicking on a tract would reveal the neighborhood/community boundary in which the tract belongs. The are three filtering options that will change the map:
- Investment type buttons will change the whole map to represent different investment type (default: aggregate investment)
- Poverty category and Race majority will highlight the map with options available in a dropdown (default: all)

## Include a _numbered_ list of questions for us to respond to.
No questions for now. I have included progress update in the Google Form Response for group critique.
